// The speak() method for Bird printed "My name is The Mighty Duck"
// instead of "My name is Duck"
// And the speak() method for Animal printed the same thing
// Bird is-a Animal, which means that a bird constructor can be used in place of an Animal constructor
// when defining an animal. However, Animal is not a subclass for Bird, and not all animals are birds, so
// it doesn't make sense to use an animal constructor for a bird, because a bird requires more parameters than an animal
